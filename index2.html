<h3>The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’ (meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact, trigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early astronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth. Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and Physical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts.

 It is one of the important branches in the history of mathematics and this concept is given by a Greek mathematician Hipparchus. Basically, it is the study of triangles where we deal with the angles and sides of the triangle. To be more specific, its all about a right-angled triangle.
