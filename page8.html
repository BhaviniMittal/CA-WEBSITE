<H2>APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY ?</H2>
<H3>TRIGONOMETRY is used into wider fields like asrronomy, engineering, physics, surveying, architecture, astronomy and even in the investigation of a crime scene.
<br><br>
Apart from astronomy and geography, trigonometry is applicable in various fields like satellite navigation, developing computer music, chemistry number theory, medical imaging, electronics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, architecture, mechanical engineering, oceanography, seismology, phonetics, image compression and game development.</H3>
<br><br>
<P> Let us consider some examples to make understanding of fundamental of the concept very easy and clear. </P>

<b><font color="green">1) The angle of elevation of the top of a tower from two points distand <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> from the base and in the same straight line with it are complementary. Prove that the height of the tower is √ab.</font></b>
<br><br><u><b>SOLUTION:</b></u> <br>
Let OT be the tower of height h.<br>
Let O be the base of the tower.<br>
Let A and B be two points on the same line through the base such that OA = a and OB = b.
<img src="qimg.png" width="300px" height="300px" align="right">
Because the angles at A and B are complementary, so let ∠TAO = a and therefore ∠TBO = 90°-a<br>IN ∆AOT, <br> tan a = OT/OA = h/a ......(i)<br> In ∆BOT,<br> tan(90°-a)=OT/OB = h/b or cot a = h/b ...... (ii)<br> Multiplying (i) and (ii) we have, <br> → tan a cot a = (h/b)(h/a) <br>→(tan a)(1/ tan b)= h<sup>2</sup>/ab<br> → 1 = h<sup>2</sup>/ab <br> → h<sup>2</sup>= ab <br> → h = √ab<br><br>
<b><font color="green">2)An aeroplane flying horizontally at a height of 2500 m above the ground is observed at an elevation of 60° and after 15 seconds, the elevation is observed to be 30°. Find the speed of the aeroplane in km/hr.</font></b>
<br><br><u><b>SOLUTION:</b></u> <br>
Initially, the aeroplane is at A and after 15 seconds its position is at C.<br>

<img src="quesimg.png" width="300px" height="300px" align="right">

∴ AC is the distance covered in 15 sec.<br>
Also, ∠AOB=60° and ∠COD=30°<BR>
AB=CD=2500 m<br>
In right ∆ ABO,<BR>
OB/AB=COT 60°  → OB= 2500/√3......(i)<BR>
In right ∆ CDO,<BR>
OD/CD=COT 30° → OD=2500√3......(ii)<BR>
From (i) and (ii),<br>
BD=OD-OB=2500√3-2500/√3 = 2500(√3-1/√3)<BR>
BD= 2500(3-1/√3) = [(2500)(2)(√3)]/3 = 5000(1.732)/3<BR>
=8660/3 m.<br>
8660/3 m is te distance covered in 5 sec.<br>
∴Speed= 8660/3*15 m/s = (8660/3*15*1000)60*60 km/hr <br>
= 692.8 km/hr <br> 
∴ Speed of the aeroplane is 692.8 km/hr
